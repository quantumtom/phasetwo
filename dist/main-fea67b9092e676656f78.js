His appearance at All Nation NY Heat was his return to solo glory. RoxRite battled some of New York’s top b-boys, and in the finals beats one of his future partners, Nasty Ray from the Bay. \\"This was my 1st event in New York,\\" RoxRite recalls, \\"the Mecca of what we do. That\'s where breaking came from; the whole movement of hip-hop came from New York, so you had to go and experience it. Up to that point I had already met a lot of the NYC pioneers outside of New York, that would go to the events and judge. But it was interesting to go there and see New York for New York; seeing it and being there, seeing the way people are there compared to where I come from; it\'s totally different. I thought, ‘this is where I came from.’ The way they dress, the way that they approach it; it all comes from here. It makes sense as to how you could be so neglected—and breaking came from being neglected, society neglected this part of New York, the Bronx, and it was torn down; then, from nothing emerges this movement of hip-hop. You\'re in your own world and you can create and step out and be different in a way, to stand out. When you look at hip-hop and breaking, that\'s what you\'re doing. Even if I did it in Windsor, California, it was for me to stand out from what I knew, but I connected to this, so I created my own path. Going to New York, I really saw all that a little bit different.\\" (June 2008)","artist":"","artisturl":"","gridsrc":"images/artwork-opt/057-t.gif","src":"images/artwork-opt/057.gif"},{"id":"58","year":"August 2008","type":"video","video":"","title":"August 2008<br />Sirqix 3<br />Tampa Bay, FL","name":"Sirqix 3<br />Tampa Bay, FL","original":"","description":"On the weekend of SirQix 3, RoxRite found out that he was not being invited back to BC One after coming in as runner-up.

A lifestyle of constant international travel was putting a real strain on his domestic life. \\"In the beginning, it was easier,\\" said RoxRite She was into the culture and dance, and she was a freelancer, so she understood. She was so supportive; she always made me feel like I could do anything.\\" RoxRite’s star continued to rise, and his work became more and more demanding. \\"Eventually, she felt like I was never giving what was needed in the relationship. I’m thinking, I’m just gonna pay for us, we’re gonna buy a house, and have a family. I gotta travel, I gotta work the way I do to make money. There’s no job that I can find that’s gonna pay me what I get paid to break. Eventually things fall apart when you’re not able to balance those things out, and that’s where it was the hardest. I even started building a bit of resentment towards breaking, because I thought it was partly me and what I love to do that was at fault for me losing this relationship. There has to be a balance; I felt that she met a lot of my needs, for the way I was living with work, but I feel like I didn’t end up meeting her needs.\\" (July 2015)","artist":"","artisturl":"","gridsrc":"images/artwork-opt/088-t.jpg","src":"images/artwork-opt/088.jpg"},{"id":"90","year":"March 2016","type":"image","video":"","title":"March 2016<br />1 Round Killer<br />St. Louis, MO","name":"1 Round Killer<br />St. Louis, MO","original":"https://twitter.com/RoxRite/status/971432799159844865","description":"One of the longest tournaments RoxRite had entered to date, 1 Round Killer featured a 64-man bracket. \\"If you went first you could decide if the battle would be a one or two round battle,\\" he explained, \\"and then you ended up with three rounds in the semi-finals and five rounds in the finals, including two other battles that went two rounds each on top of that.
